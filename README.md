# Project Void Genesis
This was a project made using Love2D which was a simple experiment with making a game rendered entirely out of mathematical equations. I have moved on from the experiment since then and requires many optimizations. I got to the point of making a simple framework of a 'shape-object-entity' system where objects act like classes for entities and shapes are the mathematical equations for the screen to draw, along with the ability to put scripts in entities. There was also an attempt at creating collision, though pretty futile.
